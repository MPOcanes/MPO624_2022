# So Many Free Resources!

[ECMWF OpenData notebooks](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time) for current forecast data: 
A Python package called  ecmwf-opendata is available from PyPi that greatly facilitates the access to this dataset. In addition, a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/ecmwf/notebook-examples/tree/master/opencharts) have been developed to demonstrate the use of this package.
