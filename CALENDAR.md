4 |Foundations:Victoria, Strategy:Khang, Tactics:Elizabeth  | Tactics:Patrick. Remaining met students: we will do the Unidata and MetPy trainings together. Please fork and clone the [the python-training repo](https://github.com/Unidata/python-training). In `jupyter lab` (or `jupyter notebook`), execute the notebooks [here, in this order](https://unidata.github.io/python-training/workshop/workshop-intro/). Please make at least one edit/ extension/ improvement, save and upload to your online Fork. In class, we will examine these and you can share your progress, questions, and project work. | Feb 8-10

13| Probability and statistical hypothesis testing (p-value estimation, confidence intervals) vocabulary. Assignment: links clickable in email, with questions from [here](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/Probability_vocabulary/README.md). Let's go over this old [exam](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/Previous_Years_Exams/2018_ADA_Quiz1_Basicstats.toohard.pdf) as an example of questions in this area. Contingency table (*marginal* and *conditional* dists), Bayes theorem in slide 12 of lec04 [here](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/users/menke/edawm/eda_lectures/).| Readings on significance testing critiques: [Ambaum 2010](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010JCLI3746.1), see also [Nicholls](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%282001%29082%3C0981%3ACAATIO%3E2.3.CO%3B2) (perhaps echoing a famous title by [Johnson in wildlife biology](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1225&context=usgsnpwrc)).  | Apr 5-7
14| HW turn-in. Brief glimpse of information theory [ppt](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/presentations_and_images/Entropy_infotheory.pdf): [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)) or *missing information*, ["one of the most fundamental discoveries of human thought"](https://www.maxent.net/).  Familiar distributions (uniform, exponential, normal) [maximize it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution#Uniform_and_piecewise_uniform_distributions) for specified width, mean, and variance respectively. (Codes to compute [mutual information](http://www.sefidian.com/2017/06/14/mutual-informationmi-entropy-implementations-python/), a non-independence generalization to "correlatedness", is in libraries in [Python](https://dit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Matlab](https://github.com/PRML/PRMLT). | Offered, not assigned: Yuval Noah Harari [brain exploder on 21st century education](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/Harari_21lessons_19education_20meaning.pdf). More class-sized: Fourier analysis [readings](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/tree/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT/Readings); *Spectral_crashcourse* is mine and its related [homework](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/Previous_Years_Exams/2020_Timeseries_Forurier_ExamAssignment.md) is due April 26. | Apr 12-14
15| Fourier analysis. My little [notebooks](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/tree/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT) have examples, but for sound there is much better stuff out there: [lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ALKGR0I5MA) and [book with .ipynb](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/), runs in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP/blob/master/code/chap01preview.ipynb). Start with the wonderful [What is up with noises? Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0). | Power spectrum plots: variance preserving vs not, log-log slopes. Imagery -- 2D FFT [(example)](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/tree/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT/Images_2Dfft) & *total wavenumber* spectrum. A glimpse of [cross-spectrum](https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/552_Notes_6c.pdf) & our ENSO 20y SST [example](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT/Cospectra_2series/cospec.sst.latersst.pdf.pdf). | Apr 19-21
16| On-paper crashcourse [homework](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/Previous_Years_Exams/2020_Timeseries_Forurier_ExamAssignment.md) due. Last thoughts on spectral analysis, perhaps [2D/imagery](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/tree/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT/Images_2Dfft) or [sound](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Course_Modules_Topics_Notebooks/series_analyses_and_FFT/FFT_sound_wavfiles.ipynb) with [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/); the [Laurel/Yanni kerfuffle](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/16/upshot/audio-clip-yanny-laurel-debate.html) is fun. | Key general concept of data modeling: [just right](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/cheatsheet-machine-learning-tips-and-tricks#diagnostics). Comps-relevant regression: thoroughly understand [this HW](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/WordProblemHeatFlux.pdf) and [this old comps question](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/Previous_Years_Exams/CompsQ_regression2012_for2016class.pdf) | Apr 26-28
